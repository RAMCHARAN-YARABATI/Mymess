# Smart Meal Booking System 🍽️

## 📌 Problem Statement

In our college, every student is charged ₹15,000 per semester for lunch at the canteen, regardless of whether they eat daily or not. Each meal costs ₹150 per day, but many students occasionally skip meals due to various reasons. Unfortunately, no refund or adjustment is provided for missed meals.

This leads to:

- **Wastage of food** in the canteen
- **Financial loss for students**
- **Lack of flexibility** in meal planning

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We propose a **Smart Meal Booking System** where students can:

- **Pre-book their meals** using a mobile/web app
- **Cancel meals in advance** if not required
- Only those who book a meal will be charged and served
